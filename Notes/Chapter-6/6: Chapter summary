Chapter 6: Arrays and Array Lists
Use arrays for collecting values.
	• An array collects a sequence of values of the same type
	• Individual elements in an array are accessed by an integer index i, using the notation array[i]
	• An array element can be used like any variable
	• An array index must be at least zero and less than the size of the array
	• A bounds error, which occurs if you supply an invalid array index, can cause your program to terminate
	• Use the expression array.length to find the number of elements in an array
	• An array reference specifies the location of an array. Copying the reference yields a second reference to the same array
	• Arrays can occur as method arguments and return values
	• With a partially filled array, keep a companion variable for the current size
	• Avoid parallel arrays by changing them into arrays of objects

Use array lists for managing collections whose size can change.
	• An array list stores a sequence of values whose size can change
	• The ArrayList class is a generic class: ArrayList<Type> collects elements of the specified type
	• Use the size method to obtain the current size of an array list
	• Use the get and set methods to access an array list element at a given index
	• Use the add and remove methods to add and remove array list elements
	• To collect numbers in array lists, you must use wrapper classes

Know when to use the enhanced for loop.
	• You can use the enhanced for loop to visit all elements of an array or array list
	• Use the enhanced for loop if you do not need the index values in the loop body

Know and use common array algorithms
	• When separating elements, don't place a separator before the first element
	• A linear search inspects elements in sequence until a match is found
	• Before inserting an element, move elements to the end of the array starting with the last one
	• Use a temporary variable when swapping two elements
	• Use the Arrays.copyOf method to copy the elements of an array into a new array

Combine and adapt algorithms for solving a programming problem
	• By combining fundamental algorithms, you can solve complex programming tasks
	• You should be familiar with the implementation of fundamental algorithms som that you can adapt them

Discover algorithms by manipulating physical objects
	• Use a sequence of coins, playing cards, or toys to visualize an array of values
	• You can use paper clips as position markers or counters

Use two-dimensional arrays for data that is arranged in rows and columns
	• Use a two-dimensional array to store tabular data
	• Individual elements in a two-dimensional array are accessed by using two index values, array[i][j]

Describe the process of regression testing
	• A test suite is a set of tests for repeated testing
Regression testing involves repeating previously run tests to ensure that known failures of prior versions do not appear in new versions of the software
